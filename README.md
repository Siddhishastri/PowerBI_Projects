# Zomato Global Restaurants Analysis with Power BI

Zomato, a global restaurant search and discovery platform, operates in multiple countries, providing detailed restaurant information and customer reviews. The company aims to uncover hidden trends and anomalies in its business data. The primary goal is to analyze this data in a manner that enables Zomato to assess their business performance more accurately and make data-driven decisions for future growth and strategy development.

**The objective of this project** is to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Zomato, a global restaurant discovery platform. The goal is to provide business insights and allow users to analyze restaurant performance across different geographic dimensions and service categories.

## Key Objectives:

**1. Total Restaurant Count:** Analyze the number of restaurants across continents, countries, and cities.

**2. Global and Granular Views:** Provide the ability to view restaurant data at a global level, with the flexibility to drill down to country, city, or even restaurant-specific details.

**3. Top Performing Restaurants by Ratings:** Identify the best-performing restaurants based on average customer ratings.

**4. Top Performing Restaurants by Cost:** Highlight restaurants with the least average cost, offering affordable dining options.

**5. Interactive Filtering:** Enable users to filter restaurant data based on:
**Geographic Dimensions:** Continent, country, and city.

**Service Types:** Whether the restaurant offers services like online delivery or table booking.

**Rating Colors:** Different rating slabs denoted by color codes (e.g., Dark Green for top ratings, Red for low ratings).

**6. Cuisine-Based Ranking:** Showcase top-ranking restaurants based on the number of cuisines they serve.

**7. Multi-Page Report:** Design a multi-page report that aligns with the companyâ€™s brand theme and allows for easy navigation between report pages.
**8. Multi-Device Access:** Ensure that the report is accessible via web browsers and mobile devices, allowing users to view insights on the go.


## Project Workflow

**1. Data Import and Transformation**

Imported all the Excel files into Power BI.
Combined all the country-level files into a single table called Zomato Global using the "Append Queries" feature.
Corrected city name errors using the Replace Value option.
Removed redundant columns like locality and locality verbose, as this information was already present in the restaurant address.

**2. Column Splitting and Merging**

Split the Restaurant Name, Address column using a delimiter but mistakenly selected "each occurrence of the delimiter" instead of the "leftmost delimiter," resulting in multiple column splits.
To resolve the issue, I merged these columns back while eliminating unwanted commas by using a custom formula:

**= Text.Combine(List.Select({[#"Restaurant Name,Address.2"], [#"Restaurant Name,Address.3"],[#"Restaurant Name,Address.4"],[#"Restaurant Name,Address.5"],[#"Restaurant Name,Address.6"],[#"Restaurant Name,Address.7"],[#"Restaurant Name,Address.8"]}, each _ <> null and _ <> ""), ",")**

This step ensured that null and blank values were handled properly, and the problem was resolved.

**3. Cuisines Data Transformation**

Created a reference table named Cuisines_by_restaurant by duplicating the original table.
Removed all columns except for Restaurant ID and Cuisines.
Used the split column feature to separate multiple cuisines listed in a single cell using a comma delimiter, then expanded these into rows for a cleaner structure.
Applied Trim to remove any extra spaces in the Cuisines text.

**4. Data Cleaning**

Removed null, blank, and duplicate values from the Country Code table to ensure consistency and data quality.
Ensured that only the Zomato Global table was visible after the transformation, hiding other unnecessary tables.
Closed and applied the changes, finalizing the data cleaning process.

## Data Modeling
Deleted unnecessary relationships between the fact table and the country-wise cuisines table.
Established a relationship between Zomato Global (Restaurant ID) and Country Wise Cuisines (Restaurant ID).

## DAX Calculations
Added a New Column for Rating Colors in the fact table using this formula:

**Rating Color = IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] > 4.5, "Dark Green",
IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] >= 4 && 'Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] <= 4.4, "Green",
IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] >= 3.5 && 'Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] <= 3.9, "Yellow",
IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating]>=2.5 && 'Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] <=3.4, "Orange",
IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] >= 1.8 && 'Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] <= 2.4, "Red",
IF('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] = 0 && 'Fact Table'[Aggregate rating] <= 1.7, "White"))))))**

### Created the following measures:

1. Total Restaurant Count:

**Total Restaurant = COUNT('Zomato Global'[Restaurant ID])**

2. Average Cost for Two:
**Average Cost = AVERAGE('Fact Table'[Average Cost for two])**

3. Average Rating:
**Average Rating = AVERAGE('Fact Table'[Aggregate rating])**

4. Cuisines Count:
**Cuisines Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('Country Wise Cuisines'[Cuisines])**

### Created a Continent Column in the Country Code table using the following formula to map countries to their respective continents:

**Continent = SWITCH('Country Code'[Country Code],
   189,"Africa",
   215,"Europe",
   37,"NAM", 
   216,"NAM", 
   30,"SAM", 
   14,"Oceania", 
   148,"Oceania", 
   "Asia")**


**Visualizations you can see here,** link

The following visualizations were created to provide insights based on the data:

**Global View:**

Displayed restaurant information across continents and countries.
Top Restaurants by Rating and Cost:

Showcased the best performing restaurants based on customer ratings and the lowest average cost.
Filters:

Enabled filtering by geographic dimensions like continent, country, and city.
Added filters based on restaurant services (online delivery, table booking) and rating colors.
