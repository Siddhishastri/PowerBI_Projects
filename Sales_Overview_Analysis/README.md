## Project Overview
The Sales Overview Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance, profit trends, and quantity metrics across four key regions: Central, East, South, and West. This dashboard allows users to dynamically filter and analyze data, enabling better business decisions based on historical and comparative metrics.

## Key Features
1. Dynamic Year Filters:

* View metrics like Sales, Profit, and Quantity by year.
* Includes a comparison of Current Year (CY) and Previous Year (PY) metrics.
2. Regional Insights:

* Metrics are segmented by four regions (Central, East, South, and West).
* Users can dynamically toggle between metrics (Sales, Profit, Quantity) for a focused analysis.
3. Trend Analysis:

* Monthly data visualized through bar sparklines.
* Includes an average line for identifying trends over time.

4. State-Wise Sales Analysis:
* Bubble Map: Visualizes sales distribution across states, with bubble size representing sales volume.
* Bar Chart: Provides a sorted view of sales by state for detailed comparison.
5. Key Metrics Table:
* Displays comparative metrics for the current and previous years:
    * CY Sales, Profit, and Quantity
    * PY Sales, Profit, and Quantity
    * YoY Growth (Year-over-Year) for all metrics.
